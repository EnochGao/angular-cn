 * @fileoverview
 * A module to facilitate use of a Trusted Types policy internally within
 * Angular specifically for bypassSecurityTrust* and custom sanitizers. It
 * lazily constructs the Trusted Types policy, providing helper utilities for
 * promoting strings to Trusted Types. When Trusted Types are not available,
 * strings are used as a fallback.
 * @security All use of this module is security-sensitive and should go through
 * security review.
