When installing the Angular CLI you are prompted to allow global collection of usage statistics.\nIf you say no or skip the prompt, no data is collected.\n\n### What is collected?\n\nUsage analytics include the commands and selected flags for each execution.\nUsage analytics may include the following information:\n\n- Your operating system \\(macOS, Linux distribution, Windows\\) and its version.\n- Package manager name and version \\(local version only\\).\n- Node.js version \\(local version only\\).\n- Angular CLI version \\(local version only\\).\n- Command name that was run.\n- Workspace information, the number of application and library projects.\n- For schematics commands \\(add, generate and new\\), the schematic collection and name and a list of selected flags.\n- For build commands \\(build, serve\\), the builder name, the number and size of bundles \\(initial and lazy\\), compilation units, the time it took to build and rebuild, and basic Angular-specific API usage.\n\nOnly Angular owned and developed schematics and builders are reported.\nThird-party schematics and builders do not send data to the Angular Team.\n",
