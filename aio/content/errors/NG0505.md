@name No hydration info in server response

@category runtime

@shortDescription No hydration info is present in server response.

@description

This error occurs when hydration is enabled on the client, but the server response
doesn't contain special serialized information about the application that hydration
logic relies on.

当在客户端启用水合时会发生此错误，但服务器响应不包含有关水合逻辑所依赖的应用程序的特殊序列化信息。

This can happen when the `provideClientHydration()` function is included in the client
part of the application configuration, but is missing in the server part of the configuration.

当 `provideClientHydration()` 函数包含在应用程序配置的客户端部分，但在配置的服务器部分中缺失时，就会发生这种情况。

In applications with the default project structure \(generated by the `ng new`\),
the `provideClientHydration()` call is added either into the `providers` array of
the main `AppModule` \(which is imported into the server module\) or into a set of
providers that are included into both client and server configurations.

在具有默认项目结构（由 `ng new` 生成）的应用程序中，将 `provideClientHydration()` 调用添加到主 `AppModule` 的 `providers` 程序数组中（导入到服务器模块中）或添加到一组提供程序中，这些提供程序包含在客户端和服务器配置。

If you have a custom setup where client and server configuration are independent
and do not share common set of providers, make sure that the `provideClientHydration()`
is also included into the set of providers used to bootstrap an application on the server.

如果你有自定义设置，其中客户端和服务器配置是独立的并且不共享公共提供程序集，请确保 `provideClientHydration()` 也包含在用于在服务器上引导应用程序的提供程序集中。

@debugging

Verify that the `provideClientHydration()` call is included into a set of providers
that is used to bootstrap an application on the server.

验证 `provideClientHydration()` 调用是否包含在一组用于在服务器上引导应用程序的提供程序中。
