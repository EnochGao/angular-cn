This error occurs when hydration is enabled on the client, but the server response
doesn't contain special serialized information about the application that hydration
logic relies on.

当在客户端启用水合时，如果服务器给出的响应中不包含有关水合逻辑所要求的特殊序列化信息，就会发生本错误。

This can happen when the `provideClientHydration()` function is included in the client
part of the application configuration, but is missing in the server part of the configuration.

如果应用程序的客户端配置中包含了 `provideClientHydration()` 函数，但在服务端配置中却没有相应的信息，就会发生这种情况。

In applications with the default project structure \(generated by the `ng new`\),
the `provideClientHydration()` call is added either into the `providers` array of
the main `AppModule` \(which is imported into the server module\) or into a set of
providers that are included into both client and server configurations.

在具有默认项目结构（由 `ng new` 生成）的应用程序中，应该将 `provideClientHydration()` 调用添加到主 `AppModule` 的 `providers` 数组中（主模块会导入到服务端模块中）或那些会同时包含在客户端配置和服务端配置中的提供者数组中。

If you have a custom setup where client and server configuration are independent
and do not share common set of providers, make sure that the `provideClientHydration()`
is also included into the set of providers used to bootstrap an application on the server.

如果你有自定义设置，其中客户端和服务器配置是彼此独立的并且不共享共用的提供者数组，请确保也把 `provideClientHydration()` 包含在用于在服务器上引导应用程序的提供者数组中。

Verify that the `provideClientHydration()` call is included into a set of providers
that is used to bootstrap an application on the server.

验证 `provideClientHydration()` 调用是否包含在一组用于在服务器上引导应用程序的提供者中。
